# App Blueprint

## Overview

A mobile application designed to help users track their daily expenses, manage their budget, and gain insights into their spending habits.

## Implemented Features

### Style and Design
- **Color Palette:** A modern and vibrant color scheme has been designed to provide a visually appealing and intuitive user experience.
- **Typography:** The 'PT Sans' font is used for a clean and readable interface.
- **Iconography:** Minimalist, line-based icons are used for expense categories.
- **Layout:** The app features a clean and intuitive layout with a focus on easy data input and clear monthly summaries.
- **Animation:** Subtle transitions are included for a smooth user experience.

### Core Functionality
- **Expense Input:** Allows users to input daily expenses with categories and amounts.
- **Budget Management:** Enables users to set a monthly expense limit. The screen shows the total expenses for the selected month, a progress bar to help visualize the spending against the budget, and the remaining budget amount, which turns red if the budget is exceeded.

## Current Plan

1. **Design the "Analytics" screen:** This screen will display a pie chart showing the breakdown of expenses by category for the selected month. It will also show a list of expenses for the selected month, grouped and sorted by category, so you can easily see where your money is going.
2. **Implement the "Analytics" screen:** This will involve:
    - Creating the UI for the "Analytics" screen.
    - Adding the `fl_chart` package to the project to create the pie chart.
    - Implementing the logic to fetch and process the expense data to be displayed on the chart and in the list.
3. **Refine the UI/UX:** I will review the entire application and make any necessary adjustments to improve the overall user experience. This will include refining the theme, adding animations, and ensuring the app is intuitive and easy to use.
